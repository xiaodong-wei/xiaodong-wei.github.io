I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Chair of Numerical Modeling and Simulation](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mns/) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017, M.S. in Civil Engineering at The University of Tokyo in 2013, and B.S. in Civil Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2011.

My research interests lie broadly in the interdisciplinary field of computational mechanics and computational geometry. Particularly, I am interested in computer-aided design, finite element and isogeometric analysis, numerical methods, image processing, deep learning, as well as their applications in engineering design/optimization, computational neuroscience, and additive manufacturing. I have been awarded with several fellowships including Bertucci Graduate Fellowship, Liang Ji-Dian Graduate fellowship and CIT Dean's Fellowship.
