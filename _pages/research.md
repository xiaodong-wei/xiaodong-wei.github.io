My research focuses on developing novel simulation-aware geometric modeling techniques for free-form, complex-shaped surfaces/volumes, 
motivated to address grand challenges in modern engineering design/optimization, computational biomedicine, and additive manufacturing. 
The related fundamental methods belong to the family of isogeometric analysis.
