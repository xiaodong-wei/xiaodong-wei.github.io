My research focuses on developing novel simulation-aware geometric modeling techniques for free-form, complex-shaped surfaces/volumes, 
motivated to address grand challenges in modern engineering design/optimization, computational biomedicine, and additive manufacturing. 
The related fundamental methods belong to the family of isogeometric analysis.

In this work, we build smooth volume models that can be directly used in computer simulation. Such a model not only describes the shape of an object, but also discretizes its interior domain in a smooth manner, thus immediately suitable for simulations based on "bulk" geometries. Moreover, as all the simulation-related properties are already built in such geometric models, it allows downstream simulations to follow a standard procedure, and thus it is of great ease to link with commercial finite element packages such as LS-DYNA.
